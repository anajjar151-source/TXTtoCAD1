# Random vibration (`random_vibration`)

"Will it survive this transport or vibration spec": the response to a random shake given as a power
spectral density (PSD) in g²/Hz, shaken where it is held. It reports the RMS (one standard
deviation, 1σ) stress and movement and judges them at 1σ or 3σ.

## When to use it

- "It ships by truck; here is the ASTM D4169 / ISTA profile": a PSD table along the vertical axis
  with a stress check.
- "It must pass MIL-STD-810 method 514 (or a launch vehicle's random spec)": copy the spec's table
  as printed, one run per axis.
- "Does the sensor end move more than 0.5 mm?": a displacement check on that face.
- Use `harmonic` for a sine sweep (an amplitude in g against frequency), `shock` for a shock
  response spectrum, and `modal` first when the question is only where it rings.

## Study

Keys beyond the [shared ones](study-file.md#shared-by-every-analysis); reads density:

- `fixtures`: required (`fixed` faces), shaken together.
- `psd`: `{"direction": [0, 0, 1], "table": [[Hz, g²/Hz], ...]}`, required.
  - `direction`: the axis it is shaken along (any non-zero vector; normalised). A spec given per
    axis is one run per axis.
  - `table`: at least two rows, frequencies rising, every value above 0. Between rows the PSD is a
    straight line on log-log axes (the way every spec is drawn, so a "+3 dB/oct" segment is just
    its two end points); outside the table it is zero. Convert a spec given in dB/oct to its corner
    points first.
- `damping_ratio`: modal damping as a share of critical, default 0.02 (2 %). The RMS response grows
  as 1/√ζ, so say what you assumed.
- `sigma`: 1 or 3, default 3: the level the checks judge at. A Gaussian response stays under 1σ
  68.3 % of the time and under 3σ 99.7 %; 3σ is the usual design level.
- Checks: `stress` (the default when the view names none), labelled "Random vibration": sigma × the
  RMS von Mises at its peak against yield, judged with the study's `margin`; `displacement`
  (`limit_mm`, optional `faces`): sigma × the RMS movement relative to the fixtures.
- View drives: `field` (`von_mises_rms`, `displacement_rms`), `sigma` (1σ or 3σ, a multiplier on
  the RMS fields), `load_scale` (k times this shake's amplitude), `threshold`. With no view it opens
  on the field and the Sigma control, at the study's `sigma`. Nothing deforms: an RMS has no sign.

```json
{"analysis": "random_vibration", "material": "aluminum-6061-t6",
 "fixtures": [{"faces": ["#o1.f1"]}],
 "psd": {"direction": [0, 0, 1], "table": [[20, 0.01], [80, 0.04], [350, 0.04], [2000, 0.007]]},
 "damping_ratio": 0.02, "sigma": 3,
 "view": {"checks": [{"kind": "stress"}, {"kind": "displacement", "limit_mm": 0.5}]}}
```

That table is 6.06 g rms from 20 to 2000 Hz.

## What it writes

- `summary`: `psd` (direction, table, `band_Hz`), `grms_input` (the input's g rms: the area under
  the table, each log-log segment integrated exactly), `damping_ratio`, `sigma`,
  `max_von_mises_rms_MPa` and `max_von_mises_MPa` (at sigma, with `_at_mm`), `yield_MPa`,
  `safety_factor` (yield over the stress at sigma), `max_displacement_rms_mm` and
  `max_displacement_mm` (at sigma, with `_at_mm`), `zero_crossing_Hz` (ν0+, the rate the stress at
  its peak crosses zero upwards: the cycle rate fatigue counts at) and
  `displacement_zero_crossing_Hz`, `modes` (each mode's frequency, its effective mass fraction along
  X, Y, Z, its `participation_factor` along the shake in √kg, its `stress_share` of the RMS stress
  at the peak, and whether it was `used`), `modes_used`, `modes_up_to_Hz`, `effective_mass_fraction`
  and `effective_mass_axis`, `total_mass_kg`, `frequency_points`, `points_per_bandwidth`, `checks`.
- Sidecar curves against frequency: `input_psd_g2_Hz`, `stress_psd_MPa2_Hz` (von Mises's equivalent
  PSD at the stress peak) and `displacement_psd_mm2_Hz` (at the most-moving node).
- The GLB: `_VON_MISES_RMS` and `_DISPLACEMENT_RMS`, both 1σ ("Stress (1σ)", "Displacement (1σ)"),
  no series. For the viewer's Shake it also carries a stretch of base acceleration synthesised from
  the PSD (one line a hertz at the PSD's level, phases from a fixed seed, so its spectrum and g rms
  are the input's) and the part's motion relative to the shaker over ten cycles of its slowest mode,
  from the few modes that carry most of it, each answering every line exactly
  (`extras.analysis.motion`, shapes as `_MOTION_MODE_n`): a Time row scrubs it and Preview's
  playbar plays it, slowed.
- Findings: a failing stress check ("Shaken at random at 6.06 g rms along Z, the part reaches
  312 MPa at 3σ, over its 276 MPa yield"); `random_response` (info) gives the RMS stress and
  movement, their 3σ values and the mode that carries the stress; `no_resonance_in_band` (info)
  when no natural frequency lies in the table; `modes_missing_mass` (warning) when the modes used
  move under 80 % of the mass along the shake.

## How it is computed

Modal superposition: the modes up to 1.5 × the table's top, each answering the base acceleration
through qᵢ = −Γᵢ Hᵢ(ω) a. The modal coordinates' cross-spectral density (Γ⊙H)(Γ⊙H)ᴴ S_a(f) is
integrated over a log frequency grid with 40 points across every mode's half-power bandwidth (2ζf)
into one covariance matrix C. A displacement's variance is φᵀ C φ. Von Mises RMS is Segalman's
quadratic form: with A the matrix that makes σ_vm² = σᵀ A σ,
σ_vm,rms = sqrt(∫ tr(A S_σσ) df) = sqrt(Σᵢⱼ Cᵢⱼ ψᵢᵀ A ψⱼ), ψ each mode's stress (D. J. Segalman,
C. W. G. Fulcher, G. M. Reese and R. V. Field, "An efficient method for calculating RMS von Mises
stress in a random vibration environment", Journal of Sound and Vibration 230(2), 393–410, 2000).
Von Mises itself is not Gaussian; its RMS is exact, and sigma × that RMS is the usual design value.

## Hand check

Miles' equation, for one mode under a PSD flat (P g²/Hz) around its natural frequency fn,
Q = 1/(2ζ): the mode's absolute acceleration is G_rms = sqrt(π/2 · fn · Q · P) g rms; its movement
relative to the base is G_rms · 9806.65 / ωn² mm rms, ωn = 2π fn; for a cantilever's tip multiply
by the first mode's participation at the tip, 1.566: x_rms ≈ 1.566 · 9806.65 · sqrt(π/2 · f1 · Q ·
P) / ω1².

A 100 mm steel cantilever, 6 x 6 mm, under a flat 0.04 g²/Hz from 20 to 1000 Hz along Z with
ζ = 0.02 (6.26 g rms in): f1 ≈ 490 Hz, G_rms ≈ 27.7 g, tip ≈ 0.045 mm rms (0.135 mm at 3σ). cadgen
gives 0.0449 mm rms, and about 9.6 MPa rms at the clamp. If a result is far from Miles with one
mode clearly dominant, check the damping, the direction and the fixtures.

The input's g rms is the square root of the table's area: a flat segment adds P (f2 − f1); a
log-log segment of slope s (s = ln(P2/P1) / ln(f2/f1)) adds P1 f1 ((f2/f1)^(s+1) − 1) / (s + 1), or
P1 f1 ln(f2/f1) when s = −1.

## Limits

- Gaussian, stationary and linear: the shake's statistics do not change over the test, the
  response is a linear filter of it, and 3σ is exceeded 0.3 % of the time. A non-Gaussian drive, or
  a part that rattles, bottoms out or yields, is outside this.
- One axis per run, every fixture moving together. A spec on three axes is three runs; cross-axis
  coupling of the shaker is not modelled.
- Modal damping, one ratio for every mode; real damping varies with the mode and the joints, and
  the RMS response scales as 1/√ζ.
- Modes up to 1.5 × the table's top. Mass that moves only in higher modes is left out
  (`modes_missing_mass` says when over 20 %); under a resonant response the effect is small.
- A real mount, softer than a fixed face, resonates lower.
- Displacement is relative to the fixtures. Stress is projected onto the nodes from each mode's
  stress, which smooths sharp corners a little.

## Adapted to fit

Ladder ([shared rungs](study-file.md#shared-by-every-analysis)), in order:

- `reduce_modes` (first): keeps only the fewest modes holding 90 % of the mass moving along the
  shake, and says how many and the share: "Kept 1 of the 2 modes up to 1500 Hz, the ones holding 61%
  of the mass moving along Z, to fit". The search for modes also stops once that share is reached.
- `frequency_grid`: a coarser frequency grid, 10 points across each resonance instead of 40. Its
  accuracy note is measured on a single resonance at the study's damping ("a single resonance's RMS
  moves under 0.1% on the coarser grid").
- `iterative`: the modes found with LOBPCG and a multigrid preconditioner. No accuracy cost.
- `local_refine` (around where the RMS stress is highest), `defeature`, `linear_elements`.
- `symmetry` is declared but not taken yet: a symmetric half needs the antisymmetric modes too.
