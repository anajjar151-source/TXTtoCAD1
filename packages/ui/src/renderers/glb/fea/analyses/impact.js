/**
 * Drop impact (lite), Tier 3: a part dropped onto a rigid floor, simulated through time. Its series is times
 * after first contact (`39.6 µs`), evenly spaced plus the moment of the peak stress, each frame's stress and
 * displacement (relative to the part's travel) its own, with the envelopes beside them and the plastic
 * strain left at the end. Its stress grows with the impact speed, not in step with the drop height, so there
 * is no load control. Where the file says the fall, the Time row is the whole motion's (`../fall.js`): it
 * falls from its height, its solved frames slowed down where it meets the floor, and it rebounds and rests.
