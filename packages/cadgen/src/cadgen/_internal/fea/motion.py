"""What a result writes for the viewer to play it over time: ``extras.analysis.motion``.

A result whose physics moves (a shaker, a shock, a load cycle, an AC field, a flow) carries the little the viewer needs
to play it truthfully, sampled sparsely so the GLB stays small; a static result carries none. Every motion is an object
with a ``kind`` and the numbers its routine reads:

- ``base_shake`` (random vibration, shock): the part's motion relative to its
  shaker, as a sum of a few mode shapes, each a hidden vertex attribute
  (``_MOTION_MODE_1`` ..., mm per unit, its largest motion 1 mm) times its
  modal history ``q`` (mm), sampled every ``step_s`` over the window shown,
  with the shaker's own acceleration over that window (``base_g``). A random
  shake's history is synthesised from its PSD (:func:`random_lines`: one line
  per hertz at the PSD's own level, random phases from a fixed seed, so the
  signal has the PSD's spectrum and rms and is the same every run) and its
  modes answer it exactly (:func:`random_history`); a shock's base pulse is
  synthesised to match its response spectrum (:func:`srs_pulse`, wavelets, the
  method shaker controllers use) and each mode's answer is integrated exactly
  (:func:`sdof`).
- ``cycle`` (fatigue): the load cycle, the stress swinging between its minimum
  and maximum (``_CYCLE_STRESS``, the cycle's peak von Mises, MPa).
- ``ac`` (AC magnetics): the field's real and imaginary parts at each vertex,
  so a phase of the cycle is ``re·cos ωt − im·sin ωt``.
- ``tracers`` (flow): pathlines through the solved velocity field
  (:func:`pathlines`), each a run of points ``step_s`` apart in real time, for
  particles to move along.

Hidden attributes ride in ``result.scalars["motion_attributes"]`` (run.py
writes them after the fields, listed nowhere else). Stdlib only at import.
