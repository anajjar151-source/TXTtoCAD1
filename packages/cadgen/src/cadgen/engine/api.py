"""The engine's verbs as functions, one per command; ``cli`` is a thin argparse over them.

    build(code, *, model=None, name=None, xbf=None, step=None, glb=None, stl=None, threemf=None, dxf=None) -> Built
    export(source, *destinations, pose=None, part=None) -> list[Written]
    snapshot(source, out, *, display=None, camera=None, grid=False, preview=False, pose=None,
             width=None, height=None, annotation=None, measurements=None) -> Drawn
    snapshot_job(job, source=None, *, the snapshot's flags) -> list[Drawn]
    serve(source, port=0) -> Served
    inspect(source, ref=None) -> Facts (the build closure without a ref)
    status() / stop() / daemon()

Every one goes through the daemon (``client``), so the warm worker of the script, of the code
(by its ``name``) or of the document does the work and keeps what it made in memory for the
next call. ``build`` takes source text or a build123d shape (the CLI takes code only) and requires an explicit destination:
``model=NAME`` holds it in memory; file flags (``xbf=``, ``step=``, ...) write to the default
path with ``True`` or to a supplied path. A script's models build when called by the script
(``python model.py``), or from Python
by ``Model.build()`` (``build_script``), a ``Report``. A build writes the model as its joints place
it; a pose, a part and a picture are the ``export`` and ``snapshot`` verbs', never cached.

The engine counts nothing. After each ``build``, ``export`` and ``snapshot`` it calls every
function in ``observers``, in the verb's thread, with one plain dict of what the verb did
(``_facts``): kinds, counts, times, the warm worker's part, and an error's type and frames --
never a name, a path or a message of the person's but the frames' files as Python has them. An
observer that raises is passed over, and the verb returns or raises as it would have. cadgen's
telemetry is one, appended by cadgen's own ``__init__`` (law 3: nothing here imports it).
