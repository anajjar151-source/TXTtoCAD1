"""Exports: a document translated to a file. One writer, one document, two triggers.

``translate(document, kind, path, *, pose=None, part=None)`` writes one
file of ``kind`` (``KINDS``: ``xbf``, ``step``, ``glb``, ``stl``, ``threemf``, ``dxf``) from a
document: a ``Source`` -- the document a build made, held in the worker's memory
(``Source.built``), or one read from an ``.xbf`` or a ``.step`` (``Source.read``). A
derived file a decorator declares and a file ``cadgen export`` asks for are the same
call, so the same document and the same options write the same bytes.

``pose`` (a configuration's name or ``{joint: value}``) places the mechanism's links by
forward kinematics before anything is written; ``part`` (one part or assembly as a ref's
owner names it, ``refs``: ``hand/finger.2``, ``palm``) writes that subtree alone, as a
document of its own: its root at the subtree's frame. Meshes are never sources: there is
no B-rep in them. An xbf is written from a STEP (read into a document
first), or from an xbf with ``part`` (a sub-assembly extracted); a posed xbf is refused,
since a pose is a request, never a document. A GLB carries every motion the document defines as a glTF animation of the same
name, baked by forward kinematics (``export/motion.py``); STEP, STL and 3MF ignore motions. A
DXF is drawn from a planar document alone (``export/dxf.py``): a 3D one is refused.

Every file is written to a temporary file beside its target and moved over it; a DXF only
when its bytes change.

Importing this package imports no kernel: a kind's writer loads on its first use.
