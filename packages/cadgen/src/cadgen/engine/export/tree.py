"""A view made a document again: the tree ``document.to_xcaf`` converts, for a STEP posed
or cut to a subtree, and for an xbf written from a STEP or extracted from an xbf.

Every prototype the view places is a part with the document's name, colour, face colours,
materials and element names; every assembly node of the view's tree is an assembly of its
own here (two placements of one sub-assembly may stand two ways once posed), each
component placed in its parent's frame. A part read from a STEP this engine did not
write takes the geometry key a build would give it, so an xbf of it caches like any, and a
whole STEP's GD&T is copied into the xbf as read (``pmi.copy``).

An xbf extracted with ``part`` carries the mechanism's share of the subtree: the links
every member of which is in it, the pairs between two such links, the configurations'
values of those pairs, the couplings' terms on those pairs, and the motions that move those
pairs alone; the ground is the document's when it is kept, else the first link kept.
