"""cadgen's engine: ``@xbf`` models built in a warm worker, kept as XCAF documents.

A model is a parameterless function returning a build123d shape::

    from cadgen.engine import xbf, step

    @xbf("XBF/arm.xbf")
    @step("arm.step")
    def arm():
        ...

An explicit ``arm()`` call builds it, and the child models its body calls, in a warm worker whose
kernel memo makes an edit cost what it changed; the document is written to
``XBF/arm.xbf`` beside the script, and the derived files it declares after it, each a
translation of that document (``cadgen export``). ``cadgen serve XBF/arm.xbf``
shows it. Nothing but those files is written: every cache lives in a process's memory.
The verbs as functions are ``cadgen.engine.api`` (``cadgen.build``, ``cadgen.export``, ...).

A function worth replaying on a later build -- an assembly's part, a derivation's stage --
is marked ``@memo``: it writes no file, and a build whose edit does not reach it replays it
instead of running it. A part's material is a value set on the shape: ``part.material = materials.aluminium``
(``Material`` for any other). An assembly's mechanism is build123d's joints, placed with
``connect_to``, as built where the joints place the parts; ``configuration(assembly, name,
**values)`` names a configuration of it, ``couple(assembly, name, **joints)`` a constraint moving
several joints by ratio (their only way to move, its range their limits'), and ``motion(assembly,
name, ...)`` a motion, which a GLB export bakes into a clip. ``read_step(path)`` and ``read_xbf(path)`` copy a file's geometry into
the model, named, coloured and given its materials as the file has them; ``read_mesh(path)`` reads
an STL as data -- vertices, triangles, ``bounding_box()`` -- never a shape. ``select(source, ref,
kind=None)`` is the geometry a ref names -- ``hand/finger.2/f:finger.tip.1``, ``base/face 3`` --
as build123d shapes in world coordinates (``refs``). ``pmi.annotate(part, pmi.datum(...),
pmi.diameter(...), ...)`` gives a part semantic PMI, written to STEP as AP242's (``pmi``).
Importing this package imports no kernel: the names below load on first use. Decoration only declares: imports and definitions never build or exit the caller.
Imported by a
script run by its path from inside a package (``python proj/parts/model.py``), it gives the
script the package ``python -m proj.parts.model`` would (``model.as_package_module``).
