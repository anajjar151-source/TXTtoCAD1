"""A warm worker: one process per model script, the memo living in it for its life.

The daemon starts one per script and talks to it over the worker's stdin and its
original stdout. A request is one JSON object per line: ``{"id", "op": "build", "script",
"functions", "cwd"}``, and, when the daemon serves documents, ``served`` (each served
path and the version served of it), ``served_keys`` (each served path and the keys of the
parts its served document holds), ``held`` (the geometry keys it holds a mesh for) and
``shapes`` (the keys it holds a shape for). The answers are frames: a JSON object on one
line and, when it has ``bytes``, exactly that many bytes after it. A build is answered by
``{"id", "log"}`` frames while it builds and ``{"id", "progress"}`` frames saying where it is
(``progress.py``: each stage, ``report`` and ``track``), a ``{"id", "patch", "bytes"}`` frame (below) for
each served xbf the moment the build has put it in place -- before the build goes on to
its exports -- one ``{"id", "done", "rssMb"}`` (the build's reports, and the worker's resident
memory after it, in MiB) or ``{"id", "failed"}``, and last ``{"id", "settled"}``. What the
model prints goes to the worker's stderr, which the daemon passes on. The worker exits when
its stdin closes: the daemon's pool closes it to retire the worker (``daemon.Pool``).

A ``{"id", "op": "where", "path", "key", "kind", "ordinal"}`` request asks what made one
element of a document this worker built (``build.made_by``): it is answered at once,
``{"id", "where": {...} | null}``, by the thread that reads the requests -- during a
build too, from the last build that named the document -- so a page asking about an
element never waits on a build.

A patch is the document as the daemon serves it, made in this process from the tree the
build saved (``document.tree_structure``), so the daemon never reads the file it was
saved as: ``patch.path``, ``patch.structure``, ``patch.meshes`` -- ``[key, size,
unmeshed]`` for each part the build changed: one the served document does not have and
whose mesh the daemon does not hold, meshed here (``mesh.mesh_shape``, the kernel's face parallelism on) --
and ``patch.shapes`` -- ``[key, size]`` for each part whose shape the daemon does not
hold, as ``mesh.shape_bytes``; the payload is the meshes' buffers, then the shapes' bytes,
in that order. A part is meshed from the very bytes that are sent, so a mesh the daemon
makes again of it is the same; and they are the part's bytes as its xbf reads back
(``mesh.shape_bytes``), so a daemon that only read the file meshes the key alike. Only what the build changed is meshed here, and only for a
document the daemon serves: a build of a document nobody serves meshes nothing, and the
parts of a served one the build did not change are meshed by the daemon's pool, when they
are asked for -- the build's answer never waits on a whole document's mesh. Each report
says how many parts the build meshed (``meshed``).

A worker whose resident memory is over its cap after a build (``CADGEN_ENGINE_WORKER_RSS_MB``,
by default a quarter of the machine's memory) is retired: its reports say so (``retired``),
and it exits once it has answered. The daemon starts a fresh one for the next build, a
restart: a model whose xbf holds its closure unchanged is taken in seconds.

A build runs with the cyclic collector off, and the worker collects once after it has
answered: the memo keeps every live result of the last builds, millions of objects, and a
full collection walks all of them -- a second on a large model, paid inside whichever call
allocates when it falls due. Off the build's path it is paid while the worker is idle.
