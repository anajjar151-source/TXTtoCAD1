"""A build: a script's models run, their results made documents, and the files they
declare written -- in this process, with the memo this process holds.

``build(script, functions)`` loads the script afresh (its own first-party modules
too: an edit anywhere in the model's code is read), runs each model named, or every
model the script defines, in one memo run, and then, outside the run, makes each
result a document (``document.collect``), names its parts' elements from the run's
history, writes the xbf when its content changed, and writes the exports in order:
those files and nothing else. Every model that ran writes its files: each target, and
then each child model its run ran, from the child's own document (its result as its body
returned it, its closure its own script's), once a build, its report under the target's
(``child_models``). A model whose body raises reports the error with the model's own
frames and leaves its files as they were.

What this process remembers between builds is in memory only: per part ``TShape``,
its element names and its geometry key; per model, the document it last wrote, kept
(``document.Kept``). A part a warm build hands back unchanged (the memo's hit is the same
object) is neither named nor keyed again; a document whose every part, placement, name
and colour is what the file already holds is not touched or rewritten; and any other
document is the kept one patched, only its changed prototypes made again.

Before a model's body runs, unless the memo replays it, its xbf is asked (``previous``):
an xbf holding the key the model has now is what the body would make, and the body is
not run, nor any file written.
