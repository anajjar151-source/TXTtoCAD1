"""cadgen: CAD models as Python, built by its engine (``cadgen.engine``) into documents (``.xbf``)
and the files they declare.

The root exports the engine's surface -- the decorators (``xbf``, ``step``, ``glb``, ``stl``,
``threemf``, ``dxf``), ``memo``, materials (``Material``, ``materials``, ``paint``), the mechanism
(``configuration``, ``motion``, ``couple``), PMI (``pmi``), the readers (``read_step``, ``read_xbf``,
``read_mesh``), ``select``, progress (``report``, ``track``) -- and its verbs as functions
(``build``, ``export``, ``snapshot``, ``serve``, ``inspect``, ``status``, ``stop``, ``daemon``),
every name loaded on first use: ``import cadgen`` imports no CAD kernel.

# Before anything imports build123d, which every cadgen entry point eventually does:
# build123d parses EVERY font in the system font folders at import time, with no
# per-file guard, so one malformed file aborts the import and every cadgen command
# with it (issue #322, upstream in build123d's register_folder), as does a font with
# no family name, whose empty name OCCT refuses (#636). This hides the fonts build123d
# cannot register from that one listing.
#
# It belongs here rather than in a launcher because the `cadgen` front door, the engine's
# warm workers and `python -m cadgen.X` children all reach cadgen by different routes, and a
# fix that covered only one of them would leave the builds it spawns still broken.
