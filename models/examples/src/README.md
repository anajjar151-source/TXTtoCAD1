The 24 parts after the first seven are the old project's, ported as they were: `@step`
became `@xbf(out="../XBF/<name>.xbf")`, `build123d` is imported directly, and the two
that also declared STL, 3MF and GLB keep those as decorators on the same function,
writing beside the xbf. Their shared builders are `lib/simple_model_library.py` (the
`make_*` parts) and `lib/part_common.py`, plain modules; `lib/color.py`'s `srgb` is the
old `cadgen.srgb`. Each takes a catalogue material, in brackets above: a part that
authors its own colour keeps it (`color=None`), one that does not takes the catalogue's.
The two print-in-place assemblies' `AssemblyHelper` frames are build123d joints: a
`RevoluteJoint` on the bored link and a `RigidJoint` on the pinned one, on the same pin
axis, paired by their label where the links stand as printed (open flat, 0 degrees).

Materials: the L-bracket is Steel 1018 and the enclosure ABS, each drawn in the
catalogue's colour (neither authored one); the fixture takes one material on its
assembly, which every part below it takes: bead-blasted Aluminum 6061-T6,
anodised in each part's own colour (`color=None`). The imports read the STEP
inputs as they are, without materials.

Each model declares its xbf alone, but the mounting plate and the gear blank (STL, 3MF and
GLB beside it) and the two PMI examples (a STEP beside it, its PMI as AP242's; their notes
come from `lib/notes.py`, the project's notes library, its text illustrative). The import
reads fixed STEP inputs committed in `../STEP/`, exported once from the enclosure and the fixture; no model writes them
(re-export one with `cadgen export ../XBF/NAME.xbf ../STEP/NAME.step`).
Build from this folder, in any order: each script builds every model it defines, for example

```
python l_bracket.py
python electronics_enclosure_base.py
python basic_shape_mating_test_fixture.py
python electronics_enclosure_base_import.py
python electronics_enclosure_base_drawing.py   # after electronics_enclosure_base.py
```

The fixture's `AssemblyHelper` frames are build123d joints: a `RigidJoint` on
each part in its own frame and `connect_to` moving the part onto the base
(`offset=` as a second fixed joint, `<frame>:offset`, as the old helper made).

`electronics_enclosure_base_drawing.py` is cadgen's `@eng_drawing`, outside the
engine: a document over a part, run in the script's own process, never a model.
It read the STEP the enclosure wrote; it reads the enclosure's xbf now
(`read_xbf(../XBF/electronics_enclosure_base.xbf)`), so build the model first, and
takes every dimension's constants from the model module. Its PDF (gitignored, as
`XBF/` is) carries no date: an unchanged drawing writes the same bytes.

`electronics_enclosure_base_import.py` keeps the drawing's old read: `read_step` of
the enclosure's STEP, plus a read of the fixture's STEP to exercise an imported
assembly's names and colours.
